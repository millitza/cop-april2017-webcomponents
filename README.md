# cop-april2017-webcomponents
Repository for participants in the web components (Polymer) meeting of the CoP HTML5 and Frontend development.

# Meeting April 12, 2017
Front end applications can be built using various frameworks. Those frameworks are often out of date before you had the opportunity to use them in your project and are sometimes characterized by major changes between versions. Additionally, performance can be an issue when using a large framework in your application. Recently, web components have gained attention as they comply with the new W3C standards. This makes front end development using web components more durable and requires little framework specific knowledge. Tonight, we would like to introduce you to web components using the light weight Polymer library and guide you in your first steps into the amazing world of web components.
